A simple exercise of reality: whatever it is that you're studying you are not alone. Your class might consist of 100, or so, fellow students. Most of them will be graduating with you. You will be all applying for the same jobs and internships; on the desk of bigcorp HR your resume will be indistinguishable from the rest of the stack.

Some conscientious people take their degrees more seriously, put their life on hold. Focus on the curriculum. Yet this focus will only serve to make you more the same. One of many. 

Nobody outside of academia (and your parents) will hold it against you that you did not carry off 100% in your every exam. A 1st may be better than a 2:1, yet the difference on your resum√© triflingly minuscule.

Pareto's Law of Efficiency states that 20% of the work will get you 80% of the results. Learn to put in the right amount of work. Embrace the imperfection and learn to live with it. An essay can never be perfect, stop obsessing with the minutiae. Every argument can fall, stop poking holes in yours. Others will do it gladly for you.

To set yourself apart from the rest of the flock one should be different. Simple as that. Get involved with extra curriculars. Do stuff. Stuff that you're not told to do, but stuff that you want to do. Fuck failure, because there is none. Every misstep is an opportunity to recalibrate your intuition. Such that when, in later life, you do happen to deal with matters of consequence, you can make better decisions. 

Chances are that there are at least a few like minded people in your institution. Maybe there are a few on your course, good for you. Join societies and clubs take classes unrelated to your course. Seek out the rest. Because doing great things requires great people.

There is no stratagem, no road to follow. To find your way is to make your own.
